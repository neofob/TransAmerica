### Google Map(s)

Tentative [route][0].

Detail on each section will be mapped later.  Preferably, they
should be in 70-120 miles range.

Is there a software to estimate the engery it takes to ride
certain route on google map given: rider weight, bike weight,
terrain profile, speed?

Update: [gmap-pedometer.com][1] seems to do the trick.
